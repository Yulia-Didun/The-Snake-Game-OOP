# The Snake Game OOP

This is a classic Snake game built using Python's Turtle module. The objective of the game is to guide the snake to eat the food and grow longer, without colliding with the walls or its own body. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own body.

## Usage
To start the game, run the main.py file. The game will open in a new window. Use the arrow keys to move the snake in the corresponding direction. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own body. You can exit the game by clicking on the window.

## Modules
The game consists of four modules:

- main.py: This is the main module that runs the game. It sets up the screen, creates the snake, food, scoreboard objects, and handles the game loop.

- snake.py: This module contains the Snake class, which defines the properties and methods of the snake object.

- food.py: This module contains the Food class, which defines the properties and methods of the food object.

- score_board.py: This module contains the ScoreBoard class, which defines the properties and methods of the scoreboard object.
